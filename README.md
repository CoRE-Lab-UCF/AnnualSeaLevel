# Observed Spatiotemporal Variabiity in the Annual Sea Level Cycle Along the Global Coast

**Author:** Amanda Barroso
The file "AllTG_Stats" is a table that lists relevant results for each tide gauge.
The columns titled with the climate modes (ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO) represent the differences (cm) between the annual amplitude during the 5 strongest years of the positive and negative phases of each climate index (refer to manuscript Figure 10 for more information).  
The significance for the amplitude trends (assesed using the two-sigma standard error of Newey-West estimator) and for the climate mode analysis (assessed using the amplitude's standard errors estimated by the harmonic regression model) are denoted as "1" when significant and as "NaN" when not significant.
